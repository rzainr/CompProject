This project outlines trends in Citibike usage across New York City. It includes a map visualization of the rides people have taken in 2024 up to November, as well as graphs outlining how ridership patterns differ between the boroughs. These visualizations aim to chart the overall health of New York City as determined by bike ridership, based on how frequent and how long citizens bike for.
